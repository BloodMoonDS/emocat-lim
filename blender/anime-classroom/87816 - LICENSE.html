I did not base it on any one particular anime classroom but took elements from a large number of reference images. In addition to the classroom there is also the hallway outside the room. I closed off the end of the hall but you could easily put multiple rooms together to make a longer hall. One idea I have is to make other types of rooms and potentially a whole school building but I started this scene over a year ago and only tend to do a little work on my models when I feel like it so it could be a long time to get something like that done. I also have a collection of other half finished models that I also want to finish.Modelling the desk object was the most complicated part. I also spent quite a bit of time getting the lighting to match the feel in the reference images that I was looking at. I would say that the biggest lesson I learnt from this project was that reference images can really help when it comes to lighting since I felt like I had a target that I was working toward.I made all of the models in this scene. All of the image textures are from photographs that I took. The background image that can be seen outside the window is a photo I took on a recent trip to Japan.Feel free to use this however you like. If you use it and mention where you got it that would be nice but is not required. I made these models as practice and am interested if you have feedback on how I can improve.</blockquote><hr /><h3>Help us moderate this file</h3><p>Blend Swap is a place to share and get awesome 3D work, if you think this blend falls into one of the following issues please file a report from <a href="http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/87816">http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/87816</a> by clicking on the <strong>Manage</strong> panel to the left of the blend and then on <strong>Report/Flag</strong>:</p><ul><li>The blend author didn't make this blend and posted it as their own.</li><li>The blend author is violating a Creative Commons License or copyright.</li><li>The blend is incomplete, work in progress, or has missing textures.</li><li>The blend contains simulation cache files and other unneeded media.</li><li>The preview image has nothing to do with the blend's contents.</li></ul><p>Your help allows the site to stay clear of broken and stolen work.</p><hr /><h4>Notes:</h4><ul><li>Do NOT report this blend if you dont' know how to use a feature on Blender, instead use the <a href="http://www.blendswap.com/questions">questions section</a> of the site.</li></ul></article><footer>Original file hosted by <a href="http://www.blendswap.com">Blend Swap, LLC</a>.</footer></body></html>
